// Exercise 1
// Create a class Human with properties name, gender, age, calories
// Add a method eatFood(food) to class Human that increases the number of calories for a human accordingly to the food's
// protein, carbs and fat properties
// Be sure to test those methods on the instances you created earlier to make sure they work

// Exercise 2
// Create a class Food with properties name, protein, carbs, fat

// Add a method printCalories() for classFood that prints out how many calories a specific food provides
// Carbohydrates provides 4 calories per gram
// Protein provides 4 calories per gram
// Fat provides 9 calories per gram
// i.e: Eating banana will add 89 calories

// Create instances of each class and print them to the console to confirm they work

// Exercise 3
// Create a subclass Man from class Human, it should have it's gender set to 'male' automatically

// Exercise 4
// Create a subclass Woman from class Human, it should have it's gender set to 'female' automatically
